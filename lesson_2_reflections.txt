--What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A repository is greated which included a .git folder with metadata to be filled regarding changes to the directory in the future. Initially all files are untracked and there are no commits, these are two things to do.

--How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It creates a temporary buffer space where you can think about what to include/disinclude in a commit, and it allows you to minimize unnecessary commits or commits that would contain errors etc.

--How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By using "git diff" to compared the staging area with the directory (new) and "git diff --staged" to compare the most recent commit with the staging are (new) one can review changes and make sure that they are a.) correct, and b.) a logical group.

--What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be helpful when you have multiple groups working on overlapping parts of a project, when you want to add a new feature that will significantly alter the existing code or when you want multiple versions of a project with differing priorities in their execution.

--How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams goes left-to-right from the earlier commits to the latest commits in a parent<--child fashion. THis is very helpful for seeing which commits represent the latest common ancestor between two or more branches.

--What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result of merging two branches together is that two "paths" of commits are connected in a common child. The child contains the changes which have been made in both paths (presumably with a way to resolve conflicts where one path deleted some line and another path added on to it). Since the child of the merge is a result of two (or more ) different branches we draw arrows to all of its parents.
